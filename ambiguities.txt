Paragraph: 7
Problem:
Our solution: We are assuming that the '_' symbol is used for ambiguity purposes, and can appear in integers, rationals and floats


Problem:
Our solution: We are assuming rationals cannot be written using a negative number in the denominator - this is to avoid the occurence
of successive '/' and '-' symbols

Paragraph: 5
Problem: We used the exact same symbols for wrapping the characters as specified in the pdf. We later found out this
was not properly parsed
Our solution: We decided to switch it with the single quote character: '
              instead of using the character: â€™

Paragraph: 8
Problem: We identified in the example dict in the specifications a nested dict that was not assigned a key/value as in key:value
Our solution: We decided to assume this is an error, and forced the key:value format to be applied. Nested dicts are still
              allowed.
